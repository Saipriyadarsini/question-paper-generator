# question-paper-generator

This application reads text from an uploaded PDF, uses a pre-trained Hugging Face model to generate unique questions from the text, formats the questions into a question paper for 50 marks, and provides a downloadable PDF of the generated question paper.
React is used for the front end.

Note:  Make sure to have the backend and frontend running simultaneously for the application to function correctly.
